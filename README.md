In this project, I explored a statistical question that I was interested in. Given two sets of Bernoulli trials (Ex: 10 trials vs 100 trials) with the same success probability, which set ends up with a higher observed success rate more often?

[This app](https://shanefaberman.shinyapps.io/win_percentage/) simulates each set of trials 10,000 times to answer this question. Users can adjust the success probability and the number of trials in both sets, from 1 to 10,000.
